Dockerfile Best practices 

Why should you listen to what I have to say?

I have spent 150+ hours analyzing at least 250+ dockerfiles from different projects.

Out there are a lot of guides on how to write dockerfiles, most of them are very rudimentary, and/or outdated. For the good stuff, you have to look through a lot of blogs, skip through the SEOed stuff.

When I was trying to write my dockerfile, I would have liked to know the principles behind each instruction than following a recipe.

In the following blog posts and videos, I will talk about how to write your docker file so that you understand why instruction is added, what it does, and how it fits in the bigger picture.

The main goal for me is that instead of giving you a dockerfile, I would like to give you a set of thinking tools that will allow you to write a more efficient dockerfile, that will allow you to save time and money for your business.

Like the proverb "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"
