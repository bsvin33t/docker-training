Why should you read/watch what what I have to say.

I have spent close to X hours looking at Y number of docker files from different projects.

Out there are a lot of guides about how the docker files have to be written,
but the issues that I had with them was that most of them are very rudimantary, and/or outdated.
For the good stuff, you really have to look through a lot of blogs, skip through the SEOed stuff.

There are authors who have written blogs,
who have not really explored/researched the underlying principle and philosophy of the commands they added in their docker files.

Docker is evolving in a rapid pace, there blogs from 2018(admitedlyt good) don't really cover the newer stuff,
where improvements have been added to docker.

eg: docker recently added buildkit, a "2nd generation" builder, which can be activated by setting a variable in docker env var.
A lot of bloggers don't really talk about it, as it is so new.

When I wrote my dockerfile, I would have liked to know why the command was written in a philosophical point of view rather than a recipe.


In the following blog posts and videos I will talk about how to write your docker file so that you understand why an instruction is added and what it does.

The main goal for me is that instead of giving you a docker file,
I would like to give you a set of thinking tools that will allow you to write a more effecient docker file,
that will allow you to save time and money for your business.

Like the proverb "give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime"
